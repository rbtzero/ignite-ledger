Subject: <4 dB/km light at 5 mm bends — ready for your lab?

Hi <Name>,

We’ve just published a parameter‑free equation (Eq. 12.1, Recursive Becoming Theory)
that collapses waveguide bend loss below **0.05 dB·m⁻¹** for a 5 mm loop at 1550 nm.
Our uncut Colab demo reproduces it in real‑time.

**Offer:** send us any GDS of a problematic bend by Friday.
We’ll return a curvature‑balanced layout + loss prediction within 48 h.
If your lab measurement matches the bound, you wire **$500k NRE** and we open
the full solver stack (Apache‑2.0) for your internal use.

Proof hash is anchored at Bitcoin block #<HEIGHT>; repo link below.

Let’s bend light the right way.
